          I am a Computer Scientist graduate from the University of Hull.
          I have developed excellent problem solving and teamwork skills through
          my degree and the past two years,
          working at Wren as a Javascript Developer.
          At Wren, I came in as a junior Dev and hit the ground running pretty much immediately,
          being set free in the bugs team & later being moved to the product team
          where all new products are realised,
          engineered and released.
          For the state of the Art, CAD system for Kitchen Planning developed on Typescript/React.

          I am now looking to further grow and develop my skills with you.
